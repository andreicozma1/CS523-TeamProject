## Pathway #2: AI as an Application: 
- Building machine learning models for a particular domain setting and evaluating them appropriately, e.g. predicting /r/AITA votes with data from Reddit. Projects in this pathway should:
1. Find or collect a [dataset](../datasets) for machine learning use.
2. Implement and train models with the dataset, i.e. with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) or [Keras](https://keras.io/).
3. Design an [evaluation](evaluations) that compares the performance of multiple models.
