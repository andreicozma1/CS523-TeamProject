## Pathway #2: AI as an Application: 
- Building machine learning models for a particular domain setting and evaluating them appropriately, e.g. predicting /r/AITA votes with data from Reddit. Projects in this pathway should:
1. Find or collect a [dataset](../datasets) for machine learning use.
2. Implement and train models with the dataset, i.e. with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) or [Keras](https://keras.io/).
3. Design an [evaluation](evaluations) that compares the performance of multiple models.

  - The NVIDIA CUDAÂ® Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization, and activation layers. 
  - Deep learning researchers and framework developers worldwide rely on cuDNN for high-performance GPU acceleration. It allows them to focus on training neural networks and developing software applications rather than spending time on low-level GPU performance tuning. cuDNN accelerates widely used deep learning frameworks, including Caffe2, Chainer, Keras, MATLAB, MxNet, PaddlePaddle, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
