# Overview
This project is required for all students enrolled in COSC 523. It is optional for students enrolled in COSC 423. This project requires that you:

1. Pick an application domain that interests you.
2. Identify a problem in that application domain.
3. Choose a **project pathway**.
   - **Pathway #1**: AI as a Tool: Introducing and evaluating a modification to an existing algorithm (e.g., A*), e.g. Path Planning with Modified a Star Algorithm for a Mobile Robot. Projects in this pathway should:
     1. Introduce and describe a new technique. 
     2. Implement the technique. 
     3. Design an evaluation with empirical or simulated data. 
     4. Compare the technique's performance with one existing technique. 
   - **Pathway #2**: AI as an Application: Building machine learning models for a particular domain setting and evaluating them appropriately, e.g. predicting /r/AITA votes with data from Reddit. Projects in this pathway should:
     1. Find or collect a dataset for machine learning use. 
     2. Implement and train models with the dataset, i.e. with scikit-learn or Keras. 
     3. Design an evaluation that compares the performance of multiple models. 
   - **Pathway #3**: AI as an Interface: Implementing interfaces that act "intelligently" and facilitate recommendations and/or search, e.g. Microsoft's LookOut system. Projects in this pathway should:
     4. Describe a scenario for integrating intelligence (e.g., recommendations) into an interface. 
     5. Implement an interface prototype that demonstrates the concept. 
     6. Conduct an informal user study with the prototype aimed at understanding how the new interfaces changes the nature of the application area. 
4. Prepare a [**proposal**](docs). Cite, at least, 5 or 6 [**research papers**](docs/research) to motivate your project. 
5. Conduct an appropriate evaluation for your pathway. 
6. Write a [**final report**](docs) about your project, its implementation, and your findings. 
7. Undergraduate students can form terms of up to 3 people, but graduate students may form teams of two
